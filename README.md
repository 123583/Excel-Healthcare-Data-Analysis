## Key Insights <a name = "key-insights"></a>

### Patients & Condition Demographics

 * A total of **55,000** patients were attended to across different hospitals.
 * The gender distribution of patients include: **Female - 50%, Male -     
   40%**,and **Non-binary - 10%**.
 * The state of **Texas** leads in the number of diagnoses with over **20,000** 
   patients.
 * **2020** is the year with the most diagnoses, pointing to the relation 
   between **COVID 19** and chronic conditions.
 * **Hypertension, Diabetes** and **Obesity** are the **Top 3** most diagnosed 
   medical conditions each affecting over **12,000** patients.
 * Majority of the diagnoses are of people within the age bracket of **21-80**.

### Conditions Distribution by Gender & Blood Type

 * Hypertension and Diabetes are more common among females while Obesity, 
   Diabetes and Hypertension are more common among men.
 * Patients with Blood Groups **A+** and **O+** are more likely to be diagnosed 
   with a chronic medical condition having recorded the most diagnoses among 
   patients recorded.
 * Cancer, Arthritis and Asthma appear to have been less frequently diagnosed 
   among the patients.

### Admissions and Hospital Trends

 * The average admission days is **15.55** days.
 * Houston Methodist Hospital leads in the number of admissions at **20,402** 
  patients accounting for almost **50%** of the total admissions.
 * Admission types are evenly distributed with Elective at **33.61%** of the 
   total admissions, closely followed by Urgent admissions(**33.47%**) , and 
   Emergency admissions(**32.92%**).
 * **Lipitor** is the most administered medication. In addition, all the 
   medications have been administered across all the conditions diagnosed.
 * All of the test results from patients diagnosed with Hypertension, 
   Cancer and Asthma are ***Abnormal*** while all test results from 
   patients diagnosed with Obesity and Arthritis are **Inconclusive** 
   and **Normal** respectively.

### Insurance & Billing

  * The total amount of bills paid is ***$1.417 Billion***
  * **Medicare** commands the insurance market share at **49.91%** with 
    a total payout of **$707.47 Million**. However, a key point of 
    concern is; Medicare only insures Female patients.

## Recommendations <a name= "recommendations"></a>

  * Initiate sensitization programs to encourage early screening for 
    chronic conditions across all the ages, especially for people with 
    **A+/O+" blood types to enhance early detection for better management 
    of the conditions.
  * Review and audit billing practices at Medicare as it accounts for 
    almost half ot the total billing and all of their payout is to female 
    patients.
  * Ensure adequate resource allocation to Houston Methodist and John 
    Hopkins Hospitals as they account for the highest admissions in order 
    to maintain excellent service delivery and comfortably meet the 
    patient volume.
